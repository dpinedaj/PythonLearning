    "Finally, its worth highlighting how easily you can perform different kinds of joins in Spark Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stream-stream joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams can be very easily joined with other streams.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stream1 = ...\n",
    "stream2 = ...\n",
    "joinedStream = stream1.join(stream2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, in each batch interval, the RDD generated by `stream1` will be joined with the RDD generated by `stream2`. You can also do `leftOuterJoin`, `rightOuterJoin`, `fullOuterJoin`. Furthermore, it is often very useful to do joins over windows of the streams. That is pretty easy as well.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "windowedStream1 = stream1.window(20)\n",
    "windowedStream2 = stream2.window(60)\n",
    "joinedStream = windowedStream1.join(windowedStream2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stream-dataset joins\n",
    "\n",
    "This has already been shown earlier while explain `DStream.transform` operation. Here is yet another example of joining a windowed stream with a dataset.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset = ... # some RDD\n",
    "windowedStream = stream.window(20)\n",
    "joinedStream = windowedStream.transform(lambda rdd: rdd.join(dataset))\n",
    "```\n",
    "In fact, you can also dynamically change the `dataset` you want to join against. The function provided to `transform` is evaluated every batch interval and therefore will use the current dataset that `dataset` reference points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete list of DStream transformations is available in the API documentation. For the Python API, see [DStream](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.streaming.html#pyspark.streaming.DStream).\n",
