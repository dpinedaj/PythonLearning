    "As shown in the figure, every time the window slides over a source DStream, the source RDDs that fall within the window are combined and operated upon to produce the RDDs of the windowed DStream. In this specific case, the operation is applied over the last 3 time units of data, and slides by 2 time units. This shows that any window operation needs to specify two parameters\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "Let’s illustrate the window operations with an example. Say, you want to extend the earlier example by generating word counts over the last 30 seconds of data, every 10 seconds. To do this, we have to apply the reduceByKey operation on the pairs DStream of (word, 1) pairs over the last 30 seconds of data. This is done using the operation reduceByKeyAndWindow.\n",

    "| **reduceByKeyAndWindow**(func, windowLength, slideInterval, [numTasks])     | When called on a DStream of (K, V) pairs, returns a new DStream of (K, V) pairs where the values for each key are aggregated using the given reduce function func over batches in a sliding window. Note: By default, this uses Spark's default number of parallel tasks (2 for local mode, and in cluster mode the number is determined by the config property spark.default.parallelism) to do the grouping. You can pass an optional numTasks argument to set a different number of tasks. |\n",
    "| **reduceByKeyAndWindow**(func, invFunc, windowLength, slideInterval, [numTasks])      | A more efficient version of the above reduceByKeyAndWindow() where the reduce value of each window is calculated incrementally using the reduce values of the previous window. This is done by reducing the new data that enters the sliding window, and “inverse reducing” the old data that leaves the window. An example would be that of “adding” and “subtracting” counts of keys as the window slides. However, it is applicable only to “invertible reduce functions”, that is, those reduce functions which have a corresponding “inverse reduce” function (taken as parameter invFunc). Like in reduceByKeyAndWindow, the number of reduce tasks is configurable through an optional argument. Note that checkpointing must be enabled for using this operation.      |\n",
