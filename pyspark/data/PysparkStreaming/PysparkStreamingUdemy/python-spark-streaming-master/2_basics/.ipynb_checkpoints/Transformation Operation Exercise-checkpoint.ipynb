    "The `transform` operation (along with its variations like `transformWith`) allows arbitrary RDD-to-RDD functions to be applied on a DStream. It can be used to apply any RDD operation that is not exposed in the DStream API. For example, the functionality of joining every batch in a data stream with another dataset is not directly exposed in the DStream API. However, you can easily use `transform to do` this. This enables very powerful possibilities. For example, one can do real-time data cleaning by joining the input data stream with precomputed spam information (maybe generated with Spark as well) and then filtering based on it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spamInfoRDD = sc.pickleFile(...)  # RDD containing spam information\n",
    "\n",
    "# join data stream with spam information to do data cleaning\n",
    "cleanedDStream = wordCounts.transform(lambda rdd: rdd.join(spamInfoRDD).filter(...))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the supplied function gets called in every batch interval. This allows you to do time-varying RDD operations, that is, RDD operations, number of partitions, broadcast variables, etc. can be changed between batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the benefit of it?\n"
