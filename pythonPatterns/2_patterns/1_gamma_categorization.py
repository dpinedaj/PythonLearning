# Design Patterns are tipically split into three categories
# Gamma Categorization "Erich Gamma"

# Creational Patterns
# - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
# - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
# - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

# Structural Patterns
# - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
# - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
# - Stress the importance of good API design

# Behavioral Patterns
# - THey are all different; no central theme
